# MyVeryFirstRepo
I wrote this up for fun and to help me remember how I set things up.

## Hardware
- Raspberry PI 3
- 32GB (or larger) SIM Card
- Any chassis with DC motors - for example: https://www.amazon.com/Emgreat-Chassis-Encoder-wheels-Battery/dp/B00GLO5SMY/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1486959207&sr=8-2&keywords=robot+chassis
- HC-SR04 sonars
- Raspberry PI compatible camera - for example: https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Camera-Module-Megapixel/dp/B01ER2SKFS/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1486960149&sr=1-1&keywords=raspberry+pi+camera

## Programs
- sample.py will run commands from the commandline
- another.py implements a simple driving algorithm using the wheels and sonal
